# Cheatsheets

This repository is a compilation of cheat sheets I created after I learned a new technology. I use them as a library to look up specific topics when I get stuck. Some of them are in German because I created them in 2019 while I was working and shared them with my German coworkers. Hopefully, some of them will help you too.
